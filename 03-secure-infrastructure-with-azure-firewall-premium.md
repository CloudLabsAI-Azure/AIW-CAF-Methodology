# Exercise 1- Secure Infrastructure with Azure Firewall Premium

Azure Firewall is a cloud-native and intelligent network firewall security service that provides the best-of-breed threat protection for your cloud workloads running in Azure. It's a fully stateful, firewall as a service with built-in high availability and unrestricted cloud scalability. It provides both east-west and north-south traffic inspection.

Azure Firewall Premium is a next-generation firewall with capabilities that are required for highly sensitive and regulated environments. It includes the following features:

- **TLS Inspection** - decrypts outbound traffic, processes the data, then encrypts the data and sends it to the destination.
- **IDPS** - A network intrusion detection and prevention system (IDPS) allows you to monitor network activities for malicious activity, log information about this activity, report it, and optionally attempt to block it.
- **URL filtering** - extends Azure Firewallâ€™s FQDN filtering capability to consider an entire URL. For example, `www.contoso.com/a/c` instead of `www.contoso.com`.
- **Web categories** - Administrators can allow or deny user access to website categories such as gambling websites, social media websites, and others.
For more information, see `https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/firewall/premium-features`
 
This exercise includes the following tasks:
  - Configure WAF to protect your web application
  - Add firewall diagnostics settings
  - Test IDPS for HTTP traffic
  - Web categories testing
  - Implement and Test URL filtering
  - IP Groups
  - Azure Firewall Policies with Firewall Manager

## Summary

In this Exercise, you'll configure an Azure Application Gateway with Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect your applications. Set up Azure Firewall for network traffic filtering, configure logging, and test intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDPS). Implement URL filtering, web categories, and IP groups for enhanced security. Optionally, use Firewall Manager to manage policies across multiple firewalls.

## Review
 
In this exercise you have covered the following:
   - Configure WAF to protect your web application
   - Added firewall diagnostics settings 
   - Tested IDPS for HTTP traffic
   - Performed Web category testing 
   - Implemented and Tested URL filtering
   - Performed IP groups
   - Performed Azure Firewall Policies with the Firewall Manager

## You have successfully completed the lab.
