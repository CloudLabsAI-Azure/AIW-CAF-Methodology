# **Exercise 3: Azure Firewall Premium**

Azure Firewall is a cloud-native and intelligent network firewall security service that provides the best-of-breed threat protection for your cloud workloads running in Azure. It's a fully stateful, firewall as a service with built-in high availability and unrestricted cloud scalability. It provides both east-west and north-south traffic inspection.

Azure Firewall Premium is a next-generation firewall with capabilities that are required for highly sensitive and regulated environments. It includes the following features:

- **TLS Inspection** - decrypts outbound traffic, processes the data, then encrypts the data and sends it to the destination.
- **IDPS** - A network intrusion detection and prevention system (IDPS) allow you to monitor network activities for malicious activity, log information about this activity, report it, and optionally attempt to block it.
- **URL filtering** - extends Azure Firewallâ€™s FQDN filtering capability to consider an entire URL. For example, `www.contoso.com/a/c` instead of `www.contoso.com`.
- **Web categories** - administrators can allow or deny user access to website categories such as gambling websites, social media websites, and others.
For more information, see `https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/firewall/premium-features`
 

In this exercise, you will explore Azure Firewall premium features and will add diagnostics settings to the firewall. You will also perform test IDPS for HTTP traffic which helps in the detection of attacks. You will also create Routes, and Subnets in the existing Route table and configure the TLS inspection and Application rules in the firewall policy to perform web testing.

## **Task 1: Add firewall diagnostics settings** 

In this task, you will enable diagnostic settings in Azure Firewall to collect firewall logs.

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to your **JumpVM-rg** resource group and select the AzureFirewall resource.

2. On the firewall page, under **Monitoring**, select **Diagnostic settings**.

   ![](images/firewall2.png "search gateway")

3. Select **Add diagnostic setting** on the **Diagnostic settings**. 

   ![](images/firewall4.png "search gateway")

4. Enter the **Diagnostic setting name** as **fw-diagnostics**.

   ![](images/firewall3.png "search gateway")

5. Under **Logs**, select **Azure Firewall Application Rule**, and **Azure Firewall Network Rule**.

   ![](images/firewall5.png "search gateway")

6. Under **Destination details**, select **Send to Log Analytics workspace** and then click on **Save**.

## **Task 2: Test IDPS for HTTP traffic**

Azure Firewall Premium provides signature-based IDPS to allow rapid detection of attacks by looking for specific patterns, such as byte sequences in network traffic, or known malicious instruction sequences used by malware.

In this task, you will test IDPS for HTTP traffic

1. On the JumpVM virtual machine, search for **Command Prompt (1)** and open  **Command Prompt (2)** window.

   ![](images/firewall9.png "search gateway")

2. Type the following command at the command prompt:

   - Replace <your web server address> with Firewall IP.

     `curl -A "HaxerMen" <your web server address>`
 
    ![](images/firewall7.png "search gateway")
 
 3. In the custom prompt you will see your Web server response.
 
    ![](images/firewall8.png "search gateway")

     ```bash
     AzureDiagnostics
     | where ResourceType == "AZUREFIREWALLS"
     | where OperationName == "AzureFirewallIDSLog"
     ```
 
    ![](images1/run1.png)
 
    > [! NOTE]
    > It can take some time for the data to begin showing in the logs. Give it at least a couple of minutes to allow for the logs to begin showing the data.
 
1. Under the **Results** tab, expand the most recent result **(1)** and observe the **msg_s (2)** row.
 
   ![](images1/result1.png)

   ![](images/firewall12.png "search gateway")
 
9. Under edit rules, change **Signature Mode** to **Alert and Deny** and click on **Save**.  Wait for the deployment to complete before proceeding.
 
   ![](images/firewall13.png "search gateway")

10. Navigate back to WorkerVM, and run the `curl` command again:

    `curl -A "HaxerMen" <your web server address>`

    Since the HTTP request is now blocked by the firewall, you'll see the following output after the connection timeout expires:

    `curl: (56) Recv failure: Connection was reset`
 
     ![](images/firewall14.png "search gateway")

 ## **Task 5: DDOS protection (Read-Only)**
 
 ### What is DDoS protection?

Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks is some of the largest availability and security concerns facing customers that are moving their applations to the cloud. A DDoS attack attempts to exhaust an application's resources, making the application unavailable to legitimate users. DDoS attacks can be targeted at any endpoint that is publicly reachable through the internet.

Azure DDoS Protection, combined with application design best practices, provides enhanced DDoS mitigation features to defend against DDoS attacks. It's automatically tuned to help protect your specific Azure resources in a virtual network. Protection is simple to enable on any new or existing virtual network, and it requires no application or resource changes.

  ![](images/ddos.png)


### Types of attacks Azure DDoS Protection mitigates

- **Volumetric attacks**: These attacks flood the network layer with a substantial amount of seemingly legitimate traffic. They include UDP floods, amplification floods, and other spoofed-packet floods. DDoS Protection mitigates these potential multi-gigabyte attacks by absorbing and scrubbing them, with Azure's global network scale, automatically.
- **Protocol attacks**: These attacks render a target inaccessible, by exploiting a weakness in the layer 3 and layer 4 protocol stack. They include SYN flood attacks, reflection attacks, and other protocol attacks. DDoS Protection mitigates these attacks, differentiating between malicious and legitimate traffic, by interacting with the client, and blocking malicious traffic.
- **Resource (application) layer attacks**: These attacks target web application packets, to disrupt the transmission of data between hosts. They include HTTP protocol violations, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and other layers 7 attacks. Use a Web Application Firewall, such as the Azure Application Gateway web application firewall, as well as DDoS Protection to provide defence against these attacks. There are also third-party web application firewall offerings available in the Azure Marketplace.
