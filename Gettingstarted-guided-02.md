# Getting Started with Your Microsoft Azure Infrastructure and Application Security Workshop

### Overall Estimated Duration : 60 Minutes

## Overview 

Organizations require robust tools to ensure secure administration and efficient management of network resources in the cloud. Azure offers a suite of services that enable comprehensive monitoring, visualization, and secure access to resources. This lab demonstrates how to utilize Azure Monitor Network Insights for real-time health monitoring, visualize network relationships using Azure Network Watcher, and securely connect to virtual machines through Azure Bastion. Additionally, it guides the configuration of NSG Flow Logs and diagnostic settings to capture and analyze network traffic for enhanced security and compliance.  

By completing this lab, you will gain practical experience in improving network security, troubleshooting connectivity issues, and monitoring traffic patterns to maintain a resilient and secure Azure environment.

## Objective  

**Secure Administration and Management**: Gain practical expertise in securing and managing Azure network resources by leveraging key Azure features and tools. Learn to monitor network health using Azure Monitor Network Insights, visualize the network topology with Azure Network Watcher, and establish secure access to virtual machines through Azure Bastion. Additionally, configure NSG Flow Logs and diagnostic settings to capture traffic data for comprehensive monitoring and analysis. This hands-on lab equips you with the skills needed to enhance the security, visibility, and efficiency of your Azure networking environment.
